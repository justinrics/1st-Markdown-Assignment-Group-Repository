### Questions

**Aside from the reasons mentioned in class, why do we need to study and analyze data?**

Louis: It is important to study and analyze data because it allows us to make more informed decisions based on facts.<br />\newline
Andrew: We need to study and analyze data to provide substance to our theoretical ideas. 
We can think and theorize all we want, however if these ideas and theories are not reflected in well-gathered and processed data, then it has no basis.<br />\newline
Justin: Aside from making data more digestible to the common people, data needs to be analyzed and studied because it tells our story. Data shows what, when and how we do the things we do. By analyzing and studying data, we are better able to predict how people will react. From this, those who are better able to understand and analyze said data will have the upper hand in their field as they are better able to anticipate and predict their competition's tendencies. These can apply in Economics, sports, logistics, e-commerce, etc. <br />\newline 
Carlo: One particular reason why we need to study and analyze data is because of the type of impact it has in modern society. We have come to a point where obtaining information and data is starting to become easier and more accessible. By learning how to study and analyze this data, we are able to make use of it for the benefit of our future professions (i.e. for Marketing Research, Statistical Research, etc.) or to learn how data may be relevant to achieve a certain goal we have in mind.<br />\newline
Brix: We live in the modern world in which data is vital for our everyday lives. Most, if not all, of the things around us involves data analysis, especially those related to advertisements and customer services. They use data to know the current trends in the community to entice and provide better products or assistance to the mass. Moreover, it helps businesses curate plans for the future by predicting the next craze in the market based on these data. <br />\newline

**Cite atleast one instance or application where data science was used and contributed on policy-making, day-to-day decisions, knowing market trends, and scientific researches.**

Louis: The ICE (Immigration and Customs enforcement) uses facial recognition on drivers licenses to check for illegal and undocumented immigrants in the US and deports them.<br />\newline
Andrew:In a study from the ECCE Department titled "Design and development of a novel acoustic rain sensor with automatec telemetry", there is a clear use of data visualization in page 7. The diagram contains a graph of the intensity of rain over 5-hour period in Infanta Quezon. This data visualization clearly shows the effectiveness of the acoustic rain sensor in measuring rain intensity.<br />\newline
Justin: One of the most famous examples wherein data science was used was during the 2002 MLB Season wherein the world was introduced to the "Moneyball Theory", which looks at percentages of how well a player hits and gets to bases. This deviated from the common scouting practice wherein scouts were looking for players who "exhibited a 'fluid arm action and easy release”(Wasserman et. al., 2005) Basically, the theory favored percentages over how well a player looks when batting. A more familiar example would be "Moreyball" for basketball, wherein, the 2 most efficient shots were the main focus of the offense, layups and three pointers.\newline
Carlo: One example would be the “Feasibility Analysis of Syndromic Surveillance Using Spatio-Temporal Epidemiological ModeleR” or also know as FASSSTER is a platform which helps to compile different data sources in compile them into more understandable and digestible information about the spread of the disease. (DOH, 2022) This was a crucial tool used to monitor the spread of the COVID-19 disease, with information aimed to help the frontliners and the government institutions on decided the right course of action to take to control the spread of COVID-19 in the Philippines. (Ateneo, 2022)
<br />\newline
Brix: Determining the Covid-19 Vaccine effectiveness is one of the applications where data science is used. According Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), data from clinical trials are used for the approval of the vaccines being made. However, as per CDC, it was found that there was some decline in vaccine effectiveness, thus needing for booster shots. Data from Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report by CDC shows that those who received primary and booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines had greater protection against the OMICRON variant. <br />\newline

**Propose atleast one data science topic that you want to pursue: Have a broad description of the topic, describe the availability of the data, what kinds of statistical method you think you will need, and who would benefit this study.**

Louis: One data science topic that interests me is weather prediction. The current state of the atmosphere such as the humidity, temperature etc. can be used to predict the weather.<br />\newline
Andrew:A data science topic that I would want to pursue would be to provide data visualization of COVID cases at different demographic features. The data would be available in the DOH Data Drop that happens everyday. This data drop includes the incoming cases for every hospital that is submitting their data to the DOH. <br />\newline
Justin: I think I want to pursue is the application of machine learning in economics, wherein a program can directly learn and analyze trends from different worldwide economies. Allowing us to see what works, and what won't and predict how well certain policies will work. The data for such should be very abundant given that there are lots of economic data generated. Such data range from GDP(Gross Domestic Product), CPI(Consumer Price Index), Gini Index/Coefficient. As for statistical methods, I think the Poisson Distribution Probability can be used to determine how good or bad a policy is likely to occur based on past performances from different economies. Obviously, it would be difficult to ascertain whether policies will work given the vast differences in factors between differeint economies.<br />\newline   
Carlo: One Data Science topic that I would like to pursue is in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Automation. The scope of the topic will cover automated detection systems for fake news or websites that seem to be untrustworthy as a primary source of information. Data will come from different sources of media that can be found on the internet. How it will work is by creating an AI with sets of data deemed as either “real information” and “fake information”, training the AI to recognize patterns within both data sets. (Sharma, 2021)  Binomial Distribution can be used to create data tables of commonly used terms which may become signifiers for the information either being “real” or “fake”. This type of study can help to automate fact-checking of the information posted on the internet, helping the consumers to figure out whether the information they are consuming is real or fake<br />\newline
Brix:I would pursue Data Visualization, mainly focusing on the data that will be presented to the mass. Some of data showed in televisions or billboards may look complicated to regular people, especially those who are not associated with the field that is being presented, thus making it difficult for them to understand these. Data presentation can be simplified, avoiding jargon, making it easier for common folk to consume. The topic is broad itself and is open to a lot of different areas. The statistical method to be used may be independent t-test to determine the effectiveness of simpler visualization by having a group with regular visualized data and another group that has the curated version of visualized data. Then, testing the understanding of both groups by a test wherein the data will be gathered. This will benefit both those who provides and presents the data, as they will be able to convey their messages easily, and the public, as they would easily get informed. <br />\newline
