### Questions

**Aside from the reasons menti5oned in class, why do we need to study and analyze data?**

Louis:<br />\newline
Andrew:
We need to study and analyze data to provide substance to our theoretical ideas. 
We can think and theorize all we want, however if these ideas and theories are not reflected in well-gathered and processed data, then it has no basis.<br />\newline
Justin: Aside from making data more digestible to the common people, data needs to be analyzed and studied because it tells our story. Data shows what, when and how we do the things we do. By analyzing and studying data, we are better able to predict how people will react. From this, those who are better able to understand and analyze said data will have the upper hand in their field as they are better able to anticipate and predict their competition's tendencies. These can apply in Economics, sports, logistics, e-commerce, etc. <br />\newline

**Cite atleast one instance or application where data science was used and contributed on policy-making, day-to-day decisions, knowing market trends, and scientific researches.**

Louis:<br />\newline
Andrew:In a study from the ECCE Department titled "Design and development of a novel acoustic rain sensor with automatec telemetry", there is a clear use of data visualization in page 7. The diagram contains a graph of the intensity of rain over 5-hour period in Infanta Quezon. This data visualization clearly shows the effectiveness of the acoustic rain sensor in measuring rain intensity.<br />\newline
Justin: One of the most famous examples wherein data science was used was during the 2002 MLB Season wherein the world was introduced to the "Moneyball Theory", which looks at percentages of how well a player hits and gets to bases. This deviated from the common scouting practice wherein scouts were looking for players who "exhibited a 'fluid arm action and easy release‚Äù(Wasserman et. al., 2005) Basically, the theory favored percentages over how well a player looks when batting. A more familiar example would be "Moreyball" for basketball, wherein, the 2 most efficient shots were the main focus of the offense, layups and three pointers.\newline
Carlo:<br />\newline
Brix:<br />\newline

**Propose atleast one data science topic that you want to pursue: Have a broad description of the topic, describe the availability of the data, what kinds of statistical method you think you will need, and who would benefit this study.**

Louis:<br />\newline
Andrew:A data science topic that I would want to pursue would be to provide data visualization of COVID cases at different demographic features. The data would be available in the DOH Data Drop that happens everyday. This data drop includes the incoming cases for every hospital that is submitting their data to the DOH. <br />\newline
Justin: I think I want to pursue is the application of machine learning in economics, wherein a program can directly learn and analyze trends from different worldwide economies. Allowing us to see what works, and what won't and predict how well certain policies will work. The data for such should be very abundant given that there are lots of economic data generated. Such data range from GDP(Gross Domestic Product), CPI(Consumer Price Index), Gini Index/Coefficient. As for statistical methods, I think the Poisson Distribution Probability can be used to determine how good or bad a policy is likely to occur based on past performances from different economies. Obviously, it would be difficult to ascertain whether policies will work given the vast differences in factors between differeint economies.<br />\newline
